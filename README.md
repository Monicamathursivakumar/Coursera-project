# Movie Seat Selection UI

This repository contains a prototype for a **Movie Seat Selection UI** that demonstrates a responsive layout and dynamic controls based on screen size. The project is designed to enhance the booking experience across various devices, ensuring smooth seat selection in cinemas and theaters.

## Overview

In this project, you'll play the role of a web UI designer and front-end developer, helping Sugarland Theaters create a seamless seat booking experience. The UI adapts to different screen sizes, providing users with an optimized experience whether they're booking from a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

The project focuses on the following key objectives:
- Designing a responsive seat map layout that adapts to different devices.
- Mapping the seats to a grid of columns and rows to be used later for booking purposes.
- Dynamically adjusting the UI controls based on screen size for an enhanced user experience.

## Project Scenario

Sugarland Theaters aims to boost cinema and theater bookings by providing a user-friendly interface for booking seats on-the-go. Whether users are booking from home or during a last-minute decision with friends, the goal is to guarantee a smooth and pleasant experience.

**Key challenges addressed:**
- Making the seat map easily navigable on small screens.
- Adjusting the controls (e.g., buttons, zooming features) based on device type.
- Offering a dynamic UI that can display portions of the seat map for easier viewing on smaller devices.

## Project Objectives

- **Prototype a Responsive Layout:** Create a flexible and responsive visual layout that works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Seat Mapping to a Grid:** Implement a seat grid that allows users to see which seats are available, booked, or selected.
- **Dynamic Controls:** Adjust UI controls such as seat sizes, zooming features, and buttons depending on the screen size, allowing users to interact with the seat map seamlessly.

## Layout Example

Sugarland Theaters provided an example of a cinema layout that inspired the seat mapping. The layout adapts dynamically based on the user's device.

### Desktop View:
- Full seat map is visible with all seats displayed at once.

### Tablet View:
- Seat map is zoomed to fit the tablet screen size.
- Buttons and seat selection controls are resized for touch input.

### Mobile View:
- The seat map is divided into sector areas that can be tapped to zoom in on specific sections.
- Larger buttons and simplified controls for easier touch navigation.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Markup for the layout and structure of the seat map.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the responsive grid and layout adjustment.
- **JavaScript**: Handles dynamic interactions, seat selection, and responsive controls.
